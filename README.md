## 3 rue FÃ©lix Faure Housing



Creation of preliminary summary project (APS in French).


This project is about a transition from a business to housing with an elevation from existing R + 1 to R + 2 (3 levels).


Here is my proposal of the spaces and moodboards for this project including:
-Ground floor: gym, dressing room, swimming pool, sauna.
-First floor: common areas with kitchen, dining room, living room and terrace.
-Second floor: 4 bedrooms with dressing room, bathroom.
